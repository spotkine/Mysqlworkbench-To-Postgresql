Here is a script to parse a Mysql Worbench diagram and generate a postgresql tables creation script.
The postgresql generation part is delivered as an adapter, so it's easy to write other output dialects generators.

Requirements: PHP5.2+ because of the use of ZipArchive extension.

To use, simply do:  php parser.php YourSchemaFile.mwb > YourPgTables.sql

That's it...
